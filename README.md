# leaf-image-classification

This repository is a short description, with notebooks, of the DL Competition organized for the students of the course Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning, at Politecnico di Milano.

In this competion we were are required to classify images of leafs (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

You can find the details of the competion on CodaLab: https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/226

The repo contains a report where it's shortly present how my team, Polimi Dropouts, approached the challenge, which was our workflow and the issues we
faced, how we decided to overcome some of them, and finally describe our best models, explaining the rationale of our
choice and the results they produced.

The notebooks included contains the implementation of some of our most succesfull models, MarkZuckmberg, SteveJobs and BillGates (sorry for the names, the pun with the name of the team was a moral obligation). The BalanceData notebook includes the code used for the preprocessing of the data.
